## Project Overview 

**This is a data analysis personal project that aims to provide insights into the cookie sales at Kevin's Cookie Company for the years *(2017, 2018, 2019, 2020)*, by sourcing/extracting the dataset, aggregating/cleaning the dataset by automating redundant processes in power query macros then afterwards analysing various aspects of the yearly cookie sales. The data cleaning automation processes ensured that any new dataset that is incorporated into the existing dataset will go through the redundant cleaning automation processes. The project aims to present i formed solutions to answer critically posed business questions from the stakeholders and management. This will be done through a keen identification of trends, make data driven recommendations and give a deeper understanding of the company's performance**

### MS EXCEl DATA CLEANING

 - Filtering out the data and removing unwanted rows, columns and data valuea in order to enhance the amalysis.
 - Addition of new columns such as the *profits* and *shipping number of days* which were going to be used in answering critical business operational queations.
 - Automated redundant processes using power query macros with main idea of not have to go through the same procedures while sourcing new data values into the dataset.
 - Conditional formating of the dataset to review KPIs
 - Creation of pivot tables that would allow for creation of pivot charts for report creation.
